nfs server shares the data on the network, in this given example we are storing data from node 1 and node 2 on storage machine

how live migration works in aws
3 machines
1. node 1
2. node 2
3. storage server

# node 1
/----Ip address given to this node------/
-> 192.168.10.1

/----commands which are need to run on node1-----/
-> sudo su
-> apt update
-> apt upgrade
-> apt install libvirt
-> apt install virt-manager
-> apt install qemu-kvm(window server 2016 is installed by default)
# open virt-manager and connect to centralised server
    then start the virtual machine -> window server 2k16
-> enable ssh on node1
    -> sudo vim /etc/hosts
    -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        PermitRootLogin yes
        PermitRootLogin without-password
    -> sudo systemctl restart ssh 
# generate keygenerator for the local user
-> ssh-keygen -t rsa
# generate keygenerator for the root user
-> sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa
# enable ssh root login for ubuntu
-> sudo passwd -l root
# generate password for root
-> sudo passwd
    -> enter UNIX password
    -> re-enter UNIX password
# we need to copy public key of node1 to node2
-> sudo ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@node2
    -> yes to confirm
    -> enter node2 password: 
    -> node1 public key is copied successfully to node2

# add connection in qemu-kvm 
-> click on add connection
    -> give connection type


# node 2
/----Ip address given to this node------/
-> 192.168.10.2

/----commands which are need to run on node2-----/
-> connect hypervisor node 2 to nfs share
-> enable password less ssh, from node 1 to node 2 and reverse, enable root login through ssh
-> then migrate
-> enable ssh on node1
    -> sudo vim /etc/hosts
    -> sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        PermitRootLogin yes
        PermitRootLogin without-password
    -> sudo systemctl restart ssh
# generate keygenerator for the local user
-> ssh-keygen -t rsa
# generate keygenerator for the root user
-> sudo ssh-keygen -t rsa
# enable ssh root login for ubuntu
-> sudo passwd -l root
# generate password for root
-> sudo passwd
    -> enter UNIX password
    -> re-enter UNIX password
# we need to copy public key of node2 to node1
-> sudo ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@node1
    -> yes to confirm
    -> enter node1 password: 
    -> node2 public key is copied successfully to node1

/-----attach node2 vm to centralised storage server------/
    -> storage -> add pool -> name : "default" -> type : netfs : Netword Exported directory
    -> add ip address : 192.168.10.5 and directory name : 
    # to check if storage server is attached to nhi
    -> showmount -e 192.168.10.5

# storage
/----Ip address given to this node------/
-> 192.168.10.5

/----commands which are need to run on storage-server-----/
-> sudo su
-> apt install nfs-server
    # after installing the server we need to create this file and add the directory which need to be shared
        -> vim /etc/exports
            /vm-store *(rw no_root_squash) 
            * : means that it will accept request form all ip address
            rw : means it is read and write operations are performed
            no_root_squash : by default it does not treat root as root user
        -> systemctl restart nfs
        -> systemctl restart nfs-server
        -> showmount  -e 192.168.10.5
    # check content of the shared directory we use
        -> ls /vm-store/
    
how to change static ip address for given machine and allocate to dhcp ip
# edit the given file
    -> sudo vim etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
        change dhcp4 : no to yes
        comment the ip address the hardcoded address




# Containers : lighweight execution units 
physical server -> VirtualMachines -> Containers

issue with VMs: it requires an Operating system, when a VM starts,first the os start and then the application starts,
so it takes some time to respond to client therefore, there is a delay in VMs
VMs are not detachable


this can be overcome by using containers: 
containers do not require the complete os, when a container starts, no os Booting required. this container execution is fast as compared to VMs.

to run containers:
1. we need container runtime
2. containers runtime is a software which allows you to create,start, stop,i.e. manage containers

ex. docker,rkt,podman,containered
-> container provides isolation

how container is created:
-> need an image
-> contains os based libraries
-> functions + platofrm(middleware) + application

how to create a container
# to create a container we use, docker environment
to download docker, we go to the docker repository 
-> hub.docker.com

how to install docker
-> sudo apt install docker.io -y

how to check docker installed or not
-> docker

how to start docker service
-> sudo systemctl start docker

how to enable docker on autostart, so that next time when system start,docker service get's started automatically
-> sudo systemctl enable docker

how to check running container on the given machine
-> sudo docker ps
-> sudo docker ps -a

container LifeCycle
-> create -> start -> execute(running mode) -> stop/pause

how to check local docker images on the system
-> sudo docker images

how to pull remote image on the local system
-> docker pull {image_name}
ex. docker pull centos
